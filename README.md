Mahjong server in Go
====================

I use this project to learn the language [Go](https://golang.org/).
The first goal is to create a server that can compute Mahjong scores,
similar to [MJScoring at Nihongo Resources](http://pomax.nihongoresources.com/downloads/mjscoring/index.php),
but then using our local rules.


## After cloning

Run `go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer` to get stringer.
